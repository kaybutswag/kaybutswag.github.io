			<p>Oh hello. Welcome to my work in progress. If it reaches its potential and hosts all my interests, it would have a web development projects, photo gallery, travel suggestions, and reading lists. But one page at a time for now. </p><br>

			<p>I am originally from the deep south town of Jackson, Mississippi. I studied economics at the University of Mississippi, and decided to moved to the quasi-southern town of Austin, Texas to master the subject. For the next three and a half years, I worked in a small economics litigation shop. I worked in all stages: conducting research, converting messy data to structured data, and helping write expert reports on the regressions and other analyses performed.</p><br>

			<p>Then here I am, a student in UT's coding bootcamp. I'm looking forward to a new, creative careeer as a web developer and hope to share more projects soon.</p><br>
